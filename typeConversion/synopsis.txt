can be four types
    primitive to basic
    primitive to user defined class
    user defined class to primitive
    user defined class to 

can convert source type to destination types
source class generally need operator type casting function and destination class needs parameterized constructor
it returns some value of type destination
however, if some value is primitive then, operator type casting function is not required
similarly, if destination is primitive, then constructor is not required
the parameter is of type of source

basic to basic
    automatic conversion (implicit)
    example : long + double + float = long
                int = float + double  // converts to integer

    explicit conversion
        paranthesis() dine

basic to userDefined
userDefined to basic
userDefined to userDefined
